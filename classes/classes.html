        The focal point of ALP is the live lectures. These lectures 
        are for people who have taken the AMCs before and want to do 
        better next year or who missed out this year and want to 
        prepare for next year.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Students should be enthusiastic about math and wish to attend the lectures
        on their initiative. We educate students on 
        learning math and pique their interest in the subject. 
        However, we do not guarantee results, and that is not the 
        essential focus of this program.
      </p>

      <p>
        This program covers the four main subjects: Algebra, Combinatorics, Geometry, 
        and Number Theory. There will be four lectures for all four of these subjects, 
        except Number Theory, which has five instead. Everything we cover is essential 
        to that subject to the AMC (and possibly AIME).
      </p>

      <p>
        There are two sessions. Each session lasts for four weeks, and each session 
        covers two of the four previously mentioned subjects. Session one consists of 
        Algebra and NT lectures, and Session two consists of Geometry and Combinatorics.
      </p>

      <p>
        In each session, there are two lectures per week. One lecture belongs to one of 
        the subjects, and the second lecture belongs to the other. The lectures under 
        one subject are all taught by the same instructor, and the timing of them under 
        one subject is the same time and date every week.
      </p>

      <p>  
        To attend a lecture, you must RSVP for it using the respective form found under 
        the <a href="/classes/schedule.html>Schedule</a> page (this also contains the time 
        and the dates of the lectures), and at least one day before the lecture, we'll 
        email you with the Zoom information. After each lecture, we post the handout and a 
        Youtube link to the recording on the <a href="/classes/materials.html">Materials</a? 
        page.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, if you want to find a brief description of any lecture, you can look at 
        that on <a href=" ">this</a> document.
