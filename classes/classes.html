      <p>
        The focal point of ALP is the live lectures. These lectures 
        are for people who have taken the AMCs before and want to do 
        better next year or who missed out this year and want to 
        prepare for next year.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Students should be enthusiastic about math and wish to attend the lectures
        on their initiative. We educate students on 
        learning math and pique their interest in the subject. 
        However, we do not guarantee results, and that is not the 
        essential focus of this program.
      </p>

        This program covers the following four subjects: Algebra, Combinatorics, 
        Geometry, and Number Theory. There will be four lectures for all of these 
        subjects except Number Theory, which will have five lectures. We will be 
        covering material pertinent to the AMC.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will not be covering all of the subjects at the same time; instead, we will 
        be splitting the subjects to be taught in two sessions. Each session lasts four 
        weeks, and each session covers two subjects. Session one consists of Algebra and 
        Number Theory, and Session two consists of Geometry and Combinatorics.
      </p>

      <p>
        There will be one lecture per week for each subject, and the lectures for different 
        subjects occur on different days. (IE. If you wanted to take both Geometry and 
        Combinatorics, you would be able to attend both lectures within the same week.) Each 
        subject will have its lectures occuring at the same time each week.
      </p>

      <p>  
        To attend a lecture, you must RSVP for it using the respective form found under the 
        <a href="/classes/schedule.html">Schedule</a> page (this also contains the time and 
        the dates of the lectures), and around one day before the lecture, we will email you 
        with the Zoom information. After each lecture, we will post the handout and a Youtube 
        link to the recording on the <a href="/classes/materials.html">Materials</a> page.
      </p>
