      <h1>Classes</h1>
      <p>
        The focal point of ALP is the live lectures. These lectures 
        are for people who have taken the AMCs before and want to do 
        better next year or who missed out this year and want to 
        prepare for next year.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Students should be enthusiastic about math and wish to attend the lectures
        on their initiative. We educate students on 
        learning math and pique their interest in the subject. 
        However, we do not guarantee results, and that is not the 
        essential focus of this program.
      </p>

        This program covers the four main subjects: Algebra, Combinatorics, Geometry, 
        and Number Theory. There will be four lectures for all four of these subjects, 
        except Number Theory, which has five instead. Everything we cover is essential 
        to that subject to the AMC (and possibly AIME).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The same instructor(s) teach the lectures under any given subject, and the 
        time of those lectures under an individual subject is the same every week. 
          <ul>
            <li>Ephram Chun is teaching the Algebra lectures.</li>
            <li>Evan Chang is teaching the Combinatorics lectures.</li>
            <li>Chirag Samantaroy is teaching the Geometry lectures.</li>
            <li>Aiden Wen and Ryan Shin are teaching the Number Theory lectures.</li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        For any individual lecture, you have the option to RSVP to that lecture. If you 
        want to attend multiple lectures, you need to RSVP to every one of those lectures. 
        You can RSVP by filling out the respective google form, and a day before the 
        lecture, you will receive the Zoom information. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After each lecture, the handout (which includes a problem set that students can 
        work on for practice afterward) and the recording will be posted on the website 
        and YouTube, respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Schedule page consists of the timing of the lectures and their respective RSVP 
        forms. The Materials page consists of the handout and the YouTube link to the 
        recording for each class.
     </p>
