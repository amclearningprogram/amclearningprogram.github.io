      <h1>Classes</h1>
      <p>
        The focal point of ALP is the live lectures. These lectures 
        are for people who have taken the AMCs before and want to do 
        better next year or who missed out this year and want to 
        prepare for next year.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Students should be enthusiastic about math and wish to attend the lectures
        on their initiative. We educate students on 
        learning math and pique their interest in the subject. 
        However, we do not guarantee results, and that is not the 
        essential focus of this program.
      </p>

        There are four subjects we cover: Algebra, Combinatorics, Geometry, and Number 
        Theory. Under each subject, four lectures cover four distinct topics, where 
        each is essential to that subject when it comes to the AMC (and possibly AIME). 
        However, this is with exception to Number Theory, which instead consists of five 
        lectures. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The same instructor(s) teach the lectures under any given subject, and the timing 
        (of those lectures) is the same every week. 
          <ul>
            <li>Ephram Chun is teaching the Algebra lectures.</li>
            <li>Evan Chang is teaching the Combinatorics lectures.</li>
            <li>Chirag Samantaroy is teaching the Geometry lectures.</li>
            <li>Aiden Wen and Ryan Shin are teaching the Number Theory lectures.</li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        For any individual lecture, you have the option to RSVP to that lecture. If you 
        want to attend multiple classes, you need to RSVP to every one of those lectures.
        You can RSVP by filling out the respective google form, and a day beforehand to 
        the class, you will receive the Zoom information. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After each lecture, the handout and the recording will be posted on the website 
        and YouTube, respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Schedule page consists of the timing of the lectures and their respective RSVP 
        forms. The Materials page consists of the handout and the YouTube link to the 
        recording for each class.
