      <p>
        ALP is always looking for more staff members to expand our resources and develop our community. 
        Please apply <a href="https://forms.gle/9yuw2eJX4q7Wx4Z4A">here</a> if you're interested in 
        becoming a staff member at ALP. The descriptions of each position, along with other information, 
        are provided below.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Front End Developer</h2>
      <p>
        Collaborate with other team members to develop and update our website. We expect the following: 
        communicating with others on any issues, creating and updating timelines, and re-inforcing 
        deadlines during the development process. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We require expertise in languages HTML, CSS, and JS. We also recommend proficiency in JavaScript 
        Frameworks and Bootstrap/Bulma. The time commitment is roughly 3 to 5 hours per week but is very 
        flexible.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Content Creator</h2>
      <p>
        As a content creator, you help create ALP's material and resources. These include but are not limited to: 
        the corresponding handouts for respective lectures (including the problem set), assist in managing projects 
        like mini-courses or other ideas, etc. We are mainly looking for people comfortable creating content based 
        on higher levels of competition math than our current AMC-oriented resources. (This is because we are 
        interested in expanding onto a bigger platform and satisfy a more broad spectrum of needs from the math 
        community.) Therefore, we highly prefer applicants who have <i>at least</i> an AIME and or MathCounts 
        Nationals qualification. (An Olympiad qualification is all the better.) The time commitment is flexible, 
        roughly at 5 to 7 hours per week.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Also, you might become a lead instructor or teaching assistant (TA) along with this position if you express 
        interest. If so, you will facilitate online discussions between instructors and students. You will also help
        teach and or help in some of our live lectures. Note: if you want to become a lead instructor or TA, we 
        recommend having previous teaching experience.
