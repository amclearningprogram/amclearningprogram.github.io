      <h1>Join Us</h1>
      <p>
        ALP is always looking for more staff members to expand our resources and develop our community. 
        Please apply <a href="https://forms.gle/ga3m9NAwuwmYLXYFA">here</a> if you're interested in 
        becoming a staff member at ALP. The descriptions of each position, along with other information, 
        are provided below.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Front End Developer</h2>
      <p>
        Collaborate with other team members to develop and update our website. We expect the following: 
        communicating with others on any issues, creating and updating timelines, and re-inforcing 
        deadlines during the development process. Web-development experience with languages such as HTML, 
        CSS, and JavaScript is required. We also recommend knowledge of and or experience with React.js, 
        Node.js, and or JQuery. The time commitment is roughly 3 to 5 hours per week but is very flexible. 
      </p>
      
      <h2>Lead Instructor/TA (Teaching Assistant)</h2>
      <p>
        (IF you choose to apply for this position, you MUST also apply for the Content Creation position.) 
        Alongside working as a content creator, creating resources such as handouts, problem sets, etc., in 
        this position, you will also take on the role of being an instructor or teaching assistant. You will 
        facilitate online discussions between instructors and students. You will also help teach and or assist 
        in some of our live lectures. The requirements and workload are the same as our content creation position 
        for the most part (as detailed below). HOWEVER, we do recommend previous teaching experience, and 
        <b>during our lecture seasons</b>, the time commitment is roughly 7 to 14 hours per week and is not 
        flexible, for that matter.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Content Creator</h2>
      <p>
        As a content creator, you help create ALP's material and resources. These include but are not limited to: 
        the corresponding handouts for respective lectures (including the problem set), assist in managing projects 
        like mini-courses or other ideas, etc. We are mainly looking for people comfortable creating content based 
        on higher levels of competition math than our current AMC-oriented resources. (This is because we are 
        interested in expanding onto a bigger platform and satisfy a more broad spectrum of needs from the math 
        community.) Therefore, we highly prefer applicants who have <i>at least</i> an AIME and or MathCounts 
        Nationals qualification. (An Olympiad qualification is all the better.) The time commitment is flexible, 
        roughly at 5 to 7 hours per week.
