      <p>
        ALP is always looking for more staff members to expand our resources and develop our community. 
        Please apply here if you're interested in becoming a staff member at ALP. The descriptions of 
        each position, along with other information, are provided below.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Front End Developer</h2>
      <p>
        Collaborate with other team members to develop and update our website. We expect the following: 
        communicating with others on any issues, creating and updating timelines, and re-inforcing 
        deadlines during the development process. Web-development experience with languages such as HTML, 
        CSS and JavaScript are required. We also recommend knowledge of and or experience with React.js, 
        Node.js, and or JQuery. The time commitment is roughly 3 to 5 hours per week but is very flexible. 
      </p>
      
      <h2>Instructor/TA</h2>
      <p>
        (IF you choose to apply for this position, you MUST also apply for the Content Creation position.) 
        Alongside working as a content creator, creating resources such as handouts, problem sets, etc., in 
        this position, you will also take on the role of being an instructor or teaching assistant. You will 
        facilitate online discussions between instructors and students. You will also help teach and or assist 
        in some of our live lectures. The workload is the same as our content creation position for the most 
        part (as detailed below). HOWEVER, during our lecture seasons, the time commitment is roughly 7 to 14 
        hours per week and is not flexible, for that matter.
