      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Are the resources ALP provides free?</b>
          <p>
            Yes, all resources ALP provides are free. We wish to touch a large audience 
            of members of the math community, and we want to provide resources that are 
            accessible to all. All students across the world interested in getting roped 
            into competition math, pique their interest in problem-solving, or those who 
            wish to improve their skill set should be able to receive the things ALP 
            offers.

          <b>Who are these resources meant for?</b>
          <p>
            Our resources target, for the most part, AMC 10/12 students. We define AMC 10/12 
            students as merely anyone looking forward to preparing for their first time 
            taking the exam OR those who wish to improve their score from the last time they 
            took the exam. (However, our resources do not guarantee any expected result.) 
            Despite this, ALP is looking to expand to different levels of competitive math 
            and possibly extend to other academic subjects or miscellaneous topics. If you 
            want to help with this, please check our <a href="aboutus/joinus.html">Join Us</a> 
            page.

          <b>Are there any prerequisites students need to have?</b>
          <p>
            We recommend students can score at least an 80 on a recent AMC 10 exam under usual 
            testing conditions. This way, you have the necessary baseline to know what you need 
            to learn and a foundation to understand most of ALP's presented topics. However, do 
            note that some lectures might be unchallenging, and other lectures might be difficult. 
            Use our resources accordingly, depending on what you want to learn and what you can 
            understand.

          <b>Do we have to attend all the lectures?</b>
          <p>
            No, students do not need to attend all of the lectures that we offer. Students have 
            the option to RSVP to the individual lectures they wish to attend. HOWEVER, please
            do not RSVP if you will not take part in the meeting. To gain the most out of our 
            resources and be ready for the AMC 10/12 exam, we recommend you attend as many 
            lectures as you can. However, this is to a point; we do not encourage burning out, 
            and if you do, feel free to take a break.
          </p>

        <li>
          <b>How long will the lectures be?</b>
          <p>
            Each lecture is roughly between 1.5 hours and 2 hours in time. Therefore, there is 
            enough time to cover both the theory portion and problems to help reinforce that. 
            Plan accordingly to make sure the lectures you want to attend fit your schedule.

          <b>Will there be homework? Is homework mandatory?</b>
          <p>
            After every lecture, there is a corresponding handout posted that covers most of the 
            material presented. Alongside the handout, there is the following problem set which 
            students can use for practice. While this is like homework, it is not required to 
            complete nor submit.

          <b>If I miss a lecture, will there be a recording of it to see later?</b>
          <p>
            Yes, all lectures are recorded and posted on our YouTube channel. You can check our 
            <a href="classes/materials.html">Materials</a> page to find the link to the video once 
            we update the page (you can also find the corresponding handout to the lectures on that 
            page).
