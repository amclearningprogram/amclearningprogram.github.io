          <b>Are the resources ALP provides free?</b>
          <p>
            Yes, all resources ALP provides are free. We wish to touch a large audience 
            of members of the math community, and we want to provide resources that are 
            accessible to all. All students across the world interested in getting roped 
            into competition math, pique their interest in problem-solving, or those who 
            wish to improve their skill set should be able to receive the things ALP 
            offers.

          <b>Who are these resources meant for?</b>
          <p>
            Our resources target, for the most part, AMC 10/12 students. We define AMC 10/12 
            students as merely anyone looking forward to preparing for their first time 
            taking the exam OR those who wish to improve their score from the last time they 
            took the exam. (However, our resources do not guarantee any expected result.) 
            Despite this, ALP is looking to expand to different levels of competitive math 
            and possibly extend to other academic subjects or miscellaneous topics. If you 
            want to help with this, please check our <a href="aboutus/joinus.html">Join Us</a> 
            page.
