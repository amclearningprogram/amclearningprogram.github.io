              6th grade, he has gotten into Math Competitions, and since then always keenly 
              looks forward to math competitions. These math competitions include the MathCounts 
              Series (which he qualified for MathCounts Nationals in), the AMC Series, and the 
              HMMT. He is always an avid enthusiast and promoter of STEM and wishes to spread a 
              free and high-quality resource to the math community. Outside of math, he enjoys 
              chatting with friends, playing sports, learning Chemistry, among others.
