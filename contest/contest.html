        Students should be enthusiastic about math and wish to attend the lectures
        on their initiative. We educate students on 
        learning math and pique their interest in the subject. 
        However, we do not guarantee results, and that is not the 
        essential focus of this program.

      <p>
        This program covers the following four subjects: Algebra, Combinatorics, Geometry, 
        and Number Theory. There will be four lectures for all of these subjects except 
        Number Theory, which will have five lectures. We will be covering material 
        pertinent to the AMC.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will not be covering all of the subjects simultaneously; instead, we will be 
        splitting the subjects, teaching them over two sessions. 
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Session 1 covers Algebra and Number Theory.</li>
        <li>Session 2 covers Combinatorics and Geometry.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Each session has two lectures every week over four weeks (except for Session 1, 
        which has one additional week for the last Number Theory lecture at the end). 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        There will be one lecture per week for each subject, and the lectures for different 
        subjects occur on different days. (IE. If you wanted to take both Geometry and 
        Combinatorics, you would be able to attend both lectures within the same week.) Each 
        subject will have its lectures occurring at the same time each week.
      </p>

      <p>  
        To attend a lecture, you can join the meeting via the Zoom information around the time 
        the class starts. You can find the Zoom information (as well as the timing and dates) 
        on our <a href="/classes/schedule.html">Schedule</a> page. After each lecture, we will 
        post the handout and a Youtube link to the recording on the 
        <a href="/classes/materials.html">Materials</a> page.
