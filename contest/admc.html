      The ADMC (ALP x DMC Mathematics Competition) is an original competition brought 
      to you by ALP (AMC Learning Program) and DMC (De Mathematics Competitions). Our 
      mission is to provide a competition that contains both problems approachable for 
      people who are just starting competition math and challenging for seasoned math 
      competitors. The contest will be run on the Mathematical Advancement Committee's 
      platform, <a href="https://admc.mathadvance.org/">admc.mathadvance.org</a>; 
      competitors will use this to access the competition rounds.
      </p>
    <h2>Format/Rules</h2>
    <p>
      There will be <b>4 rounds</b>.

            Any reported collaboration between members of different teams during this round will be 
            investigated and will likely lead to disqualification.</li>

      </ul>
      All competitors must be in 12th grade or below in the 2021-22 school year. The Tiebreaker

      the Tiebreaker Round while it is in progress since it will be held on Zoom. The Awards 
      Ceremony will be held on Zoom, and its recording will be posted on the ALP YouTube channel 
      on the same day.
