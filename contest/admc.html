      The ADMC (ALP x DMC Mathematics Competition) is an original competition brought 
      to you by ALP (AMC Learning Program) and DMC (De Mathematics Competitions). Our 
      mission is to provide a competition that contains both problems approachable for 
      people who are just starting competition math and challenging for seasoned math 
      competitors. The contest will be run on the Mathematical Advancement Committee's 
      platform, <a href="https://admc.mathadvance.org/">admc.mathadvance.org</a>; 
      competitors will use this to access the competition rounds.
      </p>
    <h2>Format/Rules</h2>
    <p>
      There will be <b>4 rounds</b>:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Individual Round #1:</b> It is 10 problems in 45 minutes and can only 
        be done by each competitor.</li>
        <li><b>Individual Round #2</b>: It is 10 problems in 60 minutes and, again, can
        only be done by each competitor. Also, it is harder than 
        Individual Round #1.</li>
        <li><b>Team Round</b>: It is 10 problems in 60 minutes but can be done by up to
        four individual competitors in collaboration as a team.</li>
        <li><b>Tiebreaker Round</b>: TBD.</li>
      </ul>
      All competitors must be in 12th grade or below in the 2021-22 school year. The Tiebreaker 
      Round will only be given to the top scoring individuals, but everyone is allowed to view 
      the Tiebreaker Round while it is in progress since it will be held on Zoom. The Awards 
      Ceremony will be held on Zoom, and its recording will be posted on the ALP YouTube channel 
      on the same day.
