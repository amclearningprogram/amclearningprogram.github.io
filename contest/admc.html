        <b>Update: There is now a trial contest available on the website so you can get a feel for the platform.</b>
      <p>
        As the math contest season is starting, we would like to announce

      The <b>ADMC (ALP x DMC Mathematics Competition)</b> is an original competition brought to you by 
      ALP (AMC Learning Program) and 
      <a href="https://detoasty3.github.io/dmc.html">DMC (De Mathematics Competitions)</a>. Our mission is 
      to provide a competition that contains both problems approachable for people who are just starting 
      competition math and problems challenging for seasoned math competitors. The contest will be run at 
      <a href="https://admc.thecalt.com/">admc.thecalt.com</a>; competitors will use this to access the 
      competition rounds and be notified of any competition updates going forward.
      </p>
    <h2>Format and Rules</h2>
    <p>
      There will be <b>4 rounds</b>.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Individual Round #1</b>:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>There will be 10 questions to be solved in 45 minutes.</li>
          <li>Each correct answer is worth 1 point. Each incorrect/blank answer is worth 0 points.</li>
          <li>The difficulty will range from early AMC 12 to mid AIME.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Individual Round #2</b>:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>There will be 10 questions to be solved in 60 minutes.</li>
          <li>Each correct answer is worth 1 point. Each incorrect/blank answer is worth 0 points.</li>
          <li>The difficulty will range from early AMC 12 to late AIME.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Team Round</b>:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>There will be 10 questions to be solved in 60 minutes.</li>
          <li>Each correct answer is worth 2 points. Each incorrect/blank answer is worth 0 points.</li>
          <li>The difficulty will range from early AMC 12 to beyond late AIME.</li>
          <li>You must collaborate with only your team members. Your team must agree upon a platform 
            in which you will communicate; the competition managers will not be able to help with this.
            Any reported collaboration between members of different teams during this round will be 
            investigated and will likely lead to disqualification.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Tiebreaker Round</b>: TBD.</li>
      </ul>
      All competitors must be in 12th grade or below in the 2021-22 school year. The Tiebreaker 
      Round will only be given to the top scoring individuals, but everyone is allowed to view 
      the Tiebreaker Round while it is in progress since it will be held on Zoom. The Awards 
      Ceremony will be held on Zoom, and its recording will be posted on the 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxwmrcXFM5zVXjnUJPiItxQ">ALP YouTube channel</a> 
      on the same day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are the rules:
      <ul>
        <li>You may not open a round until the round is posted on our website. You must start a 
          round as soon as this happens.</li>
        <li>Your only tools are a writing utensil and blank scrap paper. You may not use graph 
          paper, protractors, rulers, calculators, or electronic devices (except for one to access 
          the rounds).</li>
        <li>Every answer will be an integer between 1 and 2^21 = 2097152, inclusive. While taking 
          the rounds, please ensure that you do not make any typos in any of your answers.</li>
        <li>The team score will be the sum of all individual scores on a team (a total of 
          4Â·20 = 80 points) and the team score (a total of 20 points), for a total of 100 points. 
          Thus, it is advantageous to have the maximal four members on a team.</li>
        <li>If you find any ambiguities or flaws in a problem in a given round, please email us 
          after the round is finished at 
          <a href=mailto:"admccontest@gmail.com">admccontest@gmail.com</a> with the round and 
          problem number in question. If we decide that the problem is flawed, then we will give 
          everyone full credit for that problem. Otherwise, please use your best judgment to 
          determine what the problem is asking while taking the round.</li>
      </ul>
