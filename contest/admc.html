      The ADMC (ALP x DMC Mathematics Competition) is an original competition brought 
      to you by ALP (AMC Learning Program) and DMC (De Mathematics Competitions). Our 
      mission is to provide a competition that contains both problems approachable for 
      people who are just starting competition math and challenging for seasoned math 
      competitors. The contest will be run on the Mathematical Advancement Committee's 
      platform, <a href="https://admc.mathadvance.org/">admc.mathadvance.org</a>; 
      competitors will use this to access the competition rounds.
      </p>
    <h2>Format/Rules</h2>
    <p>
      There will be <b>4 rounds</b>:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Individual Round #1:</b> It is 10 problems in 45 minutes and can only 
        be done by each competitor.</li>
        <li><b>Individual Round #2</b>: It is 10 problems in 60 minutes and, again, can
        only be done by each competitor. Also, it is harder than 
        Individual Round #1.</li>
        <li><b>Team Round</b>: It is 10 problems in 60 minutes but can be done by 
        four individual competitors in collaboration as a team.</li>
        <li><b>Tiebreaker Round</b>: TBD.</li>
      </ul>
