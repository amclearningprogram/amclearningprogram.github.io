      <h3>Who is this for?</h3>

      <p>
        This course is for advanced high school students who are interested in 
        bettering their knowledge in summations. Earlier classes will be introductory 
        (Early AMC 10/12 level) and will most likely be reviewing for the seasoned 
        math enthusiast. Later sessions, however, will be more difficult (Final 
        questions of AMC 10/12 and beyond). You can find more information in our 
        <a href="/summations/syllabus.html">syllabus</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Any person who shares an interest in learning this topic is welcome to take 
        part in the course. There is no minimum age nor maximum age.
      </p>

      <h3>Is there an entry fee?</h3>

      <p>No, the course is free.</p>

        We post all of the materials, assignments, and lecture recordings for
        this course in Google Classroom. Students in this course must check this
        Google Classroom frequently. After the course has ended, all materials,
        assignments, and lecture recordings become public on the ALP website.
      </p>

      <p>
        A week before each lecture, all of the students receive the handout for
        that lecture. This handout will summarize the material in the lecture.
        WE highly recommend that students review the corresponding handout
        before coming to each lecture.
      </p>

      <p>
        We conduct the lectures themselves over a recorded Zoom meeting. A lead
        instructor will teach the material and walk through selected exercises.
        One or two assistant instructors will be available to answer any
        questions in the chat. Each lecture will be around 90 minutes long.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the lecture, students have one week to work through a set of
        around 10-15 curated homework questions that will review and build on
        the material taught in the lecture. Homework questions are difficult,
        and we do not expect students to solve all of them. It is encouraged
        that students give a good attempt at every problem. They are welcome to
        ask for hints on the questions from an instructor.
