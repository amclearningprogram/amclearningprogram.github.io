      <h1>Syllabus</h1>
      <p>
        In this mini-course, you will learn about summations. Summations are a
        topic that appears on the AMCs frequently. Elementary closed forms will
        be needed throughout the test. More advanced techniques will usually
        only show up in the later questions. Summation techniques often prove
        most useful on the AIME and can often be used to solve difficult
        questions in algebra, combinatorics, and number theory. Summations are
        particularly common in contests such as HMMT, CMIMC, and Purple Comet.

        This minicourse will cover four main topics about summations, which are:

        <li>
          <b>Introduction and Closed Forms</b>
          <p>
            In this class, you will learn summation notation, as well as closed
            forms for several ubiquitous sums, such as arithmetic series,
            geometric series, and arithmetico-geometric series. You will learn
            how to apply these tactics to basic summation problems on the AMC 10
            and other high school competitions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Manipulations</b>
          <p>
            In this class, you will learn elementary summation techniques that
            are found throughout the AMC tests. These include strategically
            grouping terms of a summation together, adding and multiplying
            summations together, as well as using induction. You will explore
            how base representations and repeating fractions can often be
            interpreted as summations in disguise. We will derive formulas for
            the sum of squares, cubes, and other more complicated summands.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Splitting the Summand</b>
          <p>
            A particularly ubiquitous tool in summation problems is the idea of
            splitting the summand into multiple parts. You will learn how to
            simplify a complicated sum into two or more smaller sums that can be
            more easily dealt with. You will also learn how to make a sequence
            telescope through the method of partial fractions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Advanced Strategies</b>
          <p>
            In this class, you will be introduced to some advanced strategies in
            summations, such as swapping the order of summation. You will learn
            how summations are found not just in algebra, but in combinatorics
            and number theory problems. Finally, we will tackle the hardest
            questions on the AMC 10/12, AIME, and beyond by using the material
            in this course.
