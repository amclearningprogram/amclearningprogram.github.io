      <h1>Syllabus</h1>
      <p>
        In this mini-course, you will learn about summations. Summations are a topic 
        that appears on the AMCs frequently. Elementary closed forms are necessary 
        throughout the test. More advanced techniques will usually only show up in the 
        later questions. Summation techniques often prove convenient for the AIME. We 
        can often use them to solve demanding questions in algebra, combinatorics, and 
        number theory. Summations are particularly common in contests such as HMMT, CMIMC, 
        and Purple Comet.

        This mini-course will cover four main topics about summations, which are:

        <li>
          <b>Introduction and Closed Forms</b>
          <p>
            In this class, you will learn summation notation, as well as closed
            forms for several ubiquitous sums, such as arithmetic series,
            geometric series, and arithmetico-geometric series. You will learn
            how to apply these tactics to rudimentary summation problems on the AMC 10
            and other high school competitions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Manipulations</b>
          <p>
            In this class, you will learn elementary summation techniques found 
            throughout the AMC tests. These include strategically grouping terms of a 
            summation, adding and multiplying summations together, in addition to using 
            induction. You will explore how we can often interpret base representations 
            and repeating fractions as summations in disguise. We will derive formulas 
            for the sum of squares, cubes, and other more complicated summands.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Splitting the Summand</b>
          <p>
            A particularly ubiquitous tool in summation problems is the idea of splitting 
            the summand into multiple parts. You will learn how to simplify a complicated 
            sum into two or smaller sums that are more easily calculable. You will also 
            learn how to make a sequence telescope through the method of partial fractions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Advanced Strategies</b>
          <p>
            In this class, we introduce some advanced strategies, such as swapping the order 
            of summation. You will learn that summations do not apply to only Algebra problems. 
            They also apply to exercises in combinatorics and number theory. Finally, we will 
            tackle the most difficult questions on the AMC 10/12, AIME, and beyond using the 
            material in this course.
